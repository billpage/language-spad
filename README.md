# language-spad package

SPAD, Aldor and Axiom interpreter support in Atom

![A screenshot of your package](https://github.com/billpage/fricas/wiki/images/language-spad.png)

This package adds syntax highlighting for Axiom, OpenAxiom and FriCAS SPAD and Aldor files in [Atom](http://atom.io/). Axiom is a computer algebra system originally developed by IBM and released as open source by Numerical Algorithms Group. OpenAxiom and FriCAS are forks of the original Axiom open source project. Spad is the original high level language for mathematical library development. Aldor is the next generation of this programming language and also a stand alone compiler in it's own right.

## Install

Install the package `language-spad` in Atom (Preferences->Packages) or Atom's package manager from a shell:

```bash
$ apm install language-spad
```

## Bugs

The basic syntax regex patterns seem to work for most cases. However there are most certainly still a few cases that result in wrong syntax highlighting. Feel free to fix it and send a pull request, or open an issue to report it.
